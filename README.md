# 🐱  Cat Painting

This is a fun and creative front-end project built using **HTML and CSS only**. It’s a CSS painting of a cat’s head, inspired by a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) challenge. The project focuses on learning positioning, gradients, shapes, and CSS transformations to create an illustration without using any images.
